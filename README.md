# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Using-PIC16F877A.
Obstacle Avoiding Robot is a mini project written in embedded C for ECE1005. 
This Project runs on PIC 16F877A.

**Hardware:**
1. PIC16F877A
2. IR Sensor (2Nos)
3. Ultrasonic Sensor (1Nos)
4. DC Gear Motor (2Nos)
5. L293D Motor Driver
6. Chaises (You can also build your own using cardboards)
7. Power bank (Any available power source)

**Concept of Obstacle Avoiding Robot:**

The concept of Obstacle Avoiding Robot is very simple. We use sensors to detect the presence of objects around the robot and use this data to not collide the robot over those objects. To detect an Object we can use any use sensors like IR sensor and Ultrasonic sensor.
